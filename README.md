# WisBlock examples using NodeRED

A collection of examples to interface WisBlock modules and sensors from [Node-RED](http://nodered.org).

These examples are meant to be used with RAK7391 (WisGate Developer Connect) and RAK6421 (WisBlock Pi Hat) boards.

## Installation

Every example has a README.md file with the information about:

* required modules
* special permissions (specially if you run NodeRED in a docker container)
* hardware and firmware setup

You will also have a `flow.json` file with the example code. You just have to import it in your instance of NodeRED (top right menu > import > select a fie to import).
